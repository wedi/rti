# Version History:
#
# Version 1.0:  15 Sept 2014: Initial Release
#
# Version 2.0: 13 Sept 2016: Update to include particular command line options:
#     - plot particular channels rather than all;
#     - change number of channels or number of nodes via command line;
#     - generally to use the getopt, ast packages for command line inputs;
#     - allow up to eight channels.
#
# Version 2.1: 19 Sept 2016: Update to allow a single link to be plotted.
#    
#
# Usage:
#     python histColumns.py -f file1.txt -f file2.txt ... -f filen.txt
#             -l "[rx1,tx1,ch1]" -l "[rx2,tx2,ch2]" ... -l "[rxn,txn,chn]"
#
#  where file#.txt was created using, for example:
#     python listenSomeColumns_v2.py > file#.txt
#  where rx#, tx#, ch# are the receiver id, transmitter id, and channel number 
#  for a link that you want to plot RSS data for. 
#
# Purpose: Plot a histogram of RSS for particular columns (links)
#     measured.  Compare histograms when using with multiple files,
#     in separate histograms stacked on top of each other.
