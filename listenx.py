# This script reads packet data from the listen node through the serial port
# or from a file, with file name given in the -i option on the command line,
# and prints one RSS measurement on each line for all tx, rx, ch combination,
# where the rx != tx, both rx and tx are in the list of sensors, and ch is in 
# the list of channels.  There is an option to beep at a given rate to provide
# feedback to the experimenter about what time it is / where they should be.
# This version reads in the text from the output of the XANDEM HOME kit 
# "gateway" program.
