# Version History:
#
# Version 1.0:  Initial Release
#
# Version 1.1:  27 Sept 2012.
#   Change: This version won't delete (pop) data unless it is going to enter 
#           in a new piece of data.
#
# Version x.0:  3 July 2016.
#               This version plots data from python listenx.py, which is meant
#               to gather data from the XANDEM HOME gateway.
