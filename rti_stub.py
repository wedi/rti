# Version History:
#
# Version 1.0:  Initial Release.  17 Oct 2012
# Version 2.0:  30 Oct 2014.
# Version 2.1:  3 July 2016.
#               Added actualKnown option to turn off location error calculation
#
# Purpose:  
#   This script calls functions in order to calculate radio tomographic images
#   from the following inputs: 
#       1) the locations of radio sensors; 
#       2) received signal strength (RSS) measurements between pairs of those 
#          sensors, on multiple channels.  This RTI code assumes that the RSS 
#          was recorded using listenAllLinks.py or listenx.py, which simply 
#          lists the RSS value on every (Tx, Rx, Channel) combination.  The last 
#          column is the time, in integer milliseconds from the start of the 
#          data collection.  
#   The code plots the RTI estimate.  Currently, RTI methods implemented are:
#       1) multi-channel attenuation-based (traditional) RTI.  This is the method
#          published in MASS 2012: 
#             O. Kaltiokallio, M. Bocca, and N. Patwari, Enhancing the accuracy 
#          of radio tomographic imaging using channel diversity, 9th IEEE Int'l 
#          Conference on Mobile Ad hoc and Sensor Systems, October 8-11, 2012.
#       2) multi-channel variance-based RTI.  This is the straightforward
#          extension of VRTI to multiple channels. Single-channel VRTI is 
#          described in: 
#             J. Wilson and N. Patwari, See Through Walls: Motion Tracking Using 
#          Variance-Based Radio Tomography Networks, IEEE Transactions on Mobile 
#          Computing, vol. 10, no. 5, pp. 612-621, May 2011.
#   The code outputs coordinate estimates into the file, outputFileName.
#
# Usage: 
#   cat filename.txt | python rti_stub.py
#   where filename.txt is the output listenAllLinks.py or listenx.py
#
#   Alternatively, use 
#      python listenx.py -i filename.txt | python rti_stub_v2.py 
#   if the filename.txt was recorded at the gateway node.
#
#   Alternatively, use
#      ssh root@xandem-gateway.local "/opt/xandev/exec/gateway/bin/gateway -l" | python listenx.py | python rti_stub_v2.py 
#   for a real-time operation of the script from the data collected at the Xandem gateway node.  This assumes your gateway is connected to the same local network as the computer running this script.
#   
#   There must be two files in the directory to use actualKnown == True:
#      pivotFileName
#      pathFileName
#
#   There must always be the true sensor coordinate file in the directory:
#      coordFileName
#
#   The output coordinate estimates (one per row of the input file) 
#   is saved to the file named in outputFileName.  A row of -99 -99 indicates 
#   that no person is estimated to be present in the area.
